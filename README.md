# Sleep-Debt-Calculator
Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. 
If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. 
In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator. 
The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.  

## Technologies Used

JavaScript

## Setup

To run this project, simply download the code files and open the sleepDebtCalculator.js file in your web browser or JavaScript environment.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Sleep Debt Calculator:

Open the sleepDebtCalculator.js file in your web browser or JavaScript environment.
Enter the number of hours you slept each day of the week when prompted.
Enter the ideal number of hours of sleep per night when prompted.
The program will output the total number of hours slept, the ideal number of hours slept, and the amount of "sleep debt" accumulated (if any).
